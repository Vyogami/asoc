# Sahl - a programming language with channels and coroutines

This is a virtual machine based programming language which is statically typed and has coroutines. As a mentee you'd add features to its frontend and even to its virtual machine.

## Project Tasks

### Ignoring Values with Underscore `_` Identifier

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/29
Level: Easy
Description: when `_` is used as a variable name, ignore the value like it happens in go and rust. This means no store instruction is generated. This would be useful is tuple destructuring.

### Redundant consts in .bin

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/39
Level: Easy
Description:
Right now, every constant encountered during code generation is added to a list and its index in that list is encoded as instruction Const(index, reg). The bytecode file contains all of these constants and they are copied in the register when that Const instruction is encountered.
This faulty codegen leads to multiple consts in the bytecode file which are the same but replicated. We need to store only the unique constants.

### `mut`modifier in variable declaration and function parameters

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/26
Level: Medium
Description:  
All variables would be immutable by default except the one declared with ` let mut`. Also in function parameters `mut` would precede the param type. If a param is a list or map then unless it has been marked mut we can't mutate its elements.

### Tuple Indexing

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/44
Level: Easy
Description:

```rust
let tup = a_func_which_returns_tuple()
let val = tup[0]
```

For this you would have to do the codegen part using existing opcodes(bytecode instructions). Like TupleGet(tuple_regstiser, index_register, result_register) is an opcode which has the registers with tuple. Index and where to store the result. check handle_tupleget in main.c

### Tuple Destructuring

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/28
Level: Medium
Description: `a, b, _ = a_func_which_returns_tuple()`
For this you would have to do the codegen part using existing opcodes(bytecode instructions). Like TupleGet(tuple_regstiser, index_register, result_register) is an opcode which has the registers with tuple. Index and where to store the result. check handle_tupleget in main.c

### String Interpolation

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/12
Level: Medium
Description:

```rust
let a = 101
print("Sahl $a")
print("Sahl ${100 + 1}")
```

Implement a parser.
Codegen.
add a new instruction to concat strings.
Add a cast instruction to convert from primitives(int, char, bool, double) to string. Check handle_cast in main.c

### Modules

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/35
Level: Medium
Description:

syntax would use `::`

```rust
import math
import "../cool" as cool

fun main() {
     cool::awesome(math::sin(0))
}
```

### transpilation to golang

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/43
Level: Medium
Description: This language is closest to golang in its semantics making golang an ideal choice for transpilation. This also lets us measure how slow it is compared to golang

### Channel types specified as sender or receiver

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/45
Level: Easy
Description:
Specify `<-chan<T>  to mean read only channel, and after ->chan<T> to mean write-only channel`
Add parser for these
Add semantic check to ensure value isn't written to- a read only or read from a write only.

### Rust like Structs and Enums

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/30
Level: Hard
Description:
Ability to print them like rust's `print(“{:?}”, obj)` does
If the var is mutable then all the fields of a struct are mutable otherwise not.
Structs can be stored as tuples in the vm and field access can be TupleGet. (just an idea)
Monomorphization when print(var_of_type_struct) is called.

### Super Instructions

Issue: https://github.com/abooishaaq/Sahl/issues/47
Level: Hard
Description:
Super Instructions are basically multiple instructions in a single opcode
They reduce the dispatches and unnecessary work done.
A few have been added.
First figure out a super instruction
You would need to implement a pass in regcode.rs which checks for potential super instruction insertion possibility.

Example:

```rust
LoadConstIAddStore(var_ix, const_ix). Eliminate 4 instructions:
Load(var_ix, reg_1)
Const(const_ix, reg_2)
IAdd(reg1, reg2, reg_3)
Store(var_ix, reg_3)
```

## How fast is this toy language?

As an example the go program below takes almost the same time as samples/chan.Sahl:

`package main`

```rust
import "sync"

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func sendvals(c chan int, count int, id int) {
    i := 0
    for i < count {
        c <- i
        i = i + 1
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func recvvals(c chan int, count int, id int) {
    i := 0
    for i < count {
        print(<-c, " - ", id, "\n")
        i = i + 1
    }
    wg.Done()
}

func main() {
    i := 0
    for i < 100 {
        a := make(chan int, 1000)
        wg.Add(2)
        go sendvals(a, 10000, i)
        go recvvals(a, 10000, i)
        i = i + 1
    }
    wg.Wait()
}
```
