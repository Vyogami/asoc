## Project Tasks

### Add additional buttons to check attendance+schedule for the current/previous day

Issue: https://github.com/asetalias/amibot/issues/47
Level: Easy

#### Problem

Checking attendance and class schedule for the current and previous day is the most commonly used flow in the bot for most users, as it is for me. However, this flow currently requires at least 4 button clicks and waiting for 2 bot responses. Suboptimal!
Proposed Solution
Add extra buttons just to trigger these flows. Essentially:

### Add slash commands as an alternative way to interact with amibot

Issue: https://github.com/asetalias/amibot/issues/46
Level: Hard

#### The Problem

Buttons are cool and user friendly, but sometimes less than efficient for frequently used flows.

#### Proposed Solution

Slash commands can be a cool alternative to interact with the bot and condense multiple button clicks into a single command.

### [Feature] Encrypt user credentials at rest

Issue: https://github.com/asetalias/amibot/issues/41
Level: Medium

#### Problem

We're storing user credentials in plain-text. This is less than ideal as a database breach would render them exposed.

#### Solution

Encrypt these credentials while storing, decrypt them while using. A secure symmetric algorithm like AES-256 should suffice.
