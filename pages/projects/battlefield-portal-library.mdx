                Currently if a user cancels the login flow or the flow becomes corrupt, we show a bare bones html template.

                In the community many people have create more than one Experience and it would be awesome if you could showcase some of the Experiences created by the user on the Experience Page 
                
                The Experiences created by the same user must be displayed at the bottom of the page.

                Cloudflare provides free caching service to all users, but Currently we are not making use of it on the Frontend, 
                this leads to more requests at server and more cpu cycles.

                we can add caching to Frontend by making use of the `Cache-Control` http header. 
                In this task you will 
                - Identify all the points where we can use Cache
                - Think of an efficient way to add headers for all points
                - Set cache age accordingly

                Issue Tracker - [#108](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg/issues/108)
                
                A creator of a custom game mode almost always wants to publish their game mode on different settings as many players prefer to play a game mode on different "eras",
                So Currently the user submits many experiences which are essentially the same with some different settings, this leads to the home page becoming very cluttered.
                So we are looking add "Variants" of a experiences that the user can add and they wont be show on the page by default.

                This task has major feature addition on both backend and frontend, 
                - Frontend
                    - Design or use the current decided UI to display that a experience has Variants
                    - Think of a good way to show variants.
                    - Come up with a workflow to submit/mark experiences as variants.
                - Backend
                    - Create a relationship between the main and variant experience.
                    - Update the form builder accordingly.
                    - add a way to manage already existing experiences.
