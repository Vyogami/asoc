### [shuttle] Envoirement syncronisation between worskpaces

<Chip level={'Hard'} url={"https://github.com/Blonteractor/discord-amibot/issues/9"} />

**Description**

As shuttle doesn't use a normal .env file but a special Secrets.toml which can only be accessed by the bot workspace. But the amizone workspace also needs to access some secrets.
After much thought I decided the best way would be to create another worspace that acts as a secrets manager(?). Then the other workspaces can ask it for secrets
