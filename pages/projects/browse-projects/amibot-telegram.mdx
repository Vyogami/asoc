### Add monitoring of performance metrics

Issue: https://github.com/asetalias/amibot-tg/issues/61
Level: Hard
Description:

It is critical for us to be able to see how our bot is being used. We should be able to track the following:

- Daily Active Users
- Monthly Active Users
- After a request is made:
  - How long did go-amizone take to process the request
  - How long did amibot take to process the response from go-amizone

Level: Hard, lots to consider here like where to store the logs, how to access them, do we need a separate API or external service?
