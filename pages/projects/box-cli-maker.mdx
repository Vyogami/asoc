## Project Tasks


### Enhance `README.md` 

<Chip level={'Easy'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/38"} />
**Description**

I have written a README which people don't bother reading because of its complexity, and the screenshots can be showcased in a better way.

---
### Add more examples

<Chip level={'Easy'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/37"} />
**Description**

I have added many examples in examples/, but more examples you think should be added are welcome!

---

### Update dependencies

<Chip level={'Easy'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/33"} />
**Description**

Dependencies have been outdated for a long time, so they need to be updated to the latest version.

To know where to start updating look at [go.mod](https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/blob/master/go.mod).

### Remove `errorMsg` and replace it with `err` type

<Chip level={'Hard'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/36"} />
**Description**

There is a function `errorMsg` which prints to the `stderr` stream when there is an error. In production open must never print to `stderr` because it may conflict with other things present in the product, and can cause debugging to become very hard.

For example, the below code can be turned into:
```go
// roundOffTitleColor rounds off 24 bit Color to the terminals maximum color capacity for Title.
func (b Box) roundOffTitleColor(col color.RGBColor, title string) string {
	switch detectTerminalColor() {
	case terminfo.ColorLevelNone:
		errorMsg("[warning]: terminal does not support colors, using no effects")
		return title
	case terminfo.ColorLevelMillions:
		return col.Sprint(title)
	default:
		return col.C256().Sprint(title)
	}
}
```
```go
// roundOffTitleColor rounds off 24 bit Color to the terminals maximum color capacity for Title.
func (b Box) roundOffTitleColor(col color.RGBColor, title string) (string, err) {
	switch detectTerminalColor() {
	case terminfo.ColorLevelNone:
		return title, errors.New("terminal does not support colors")
	case terminfo.ColorLevelMillions:
		return col.Sprint(title), nil
	default:
		return col.C256().Sprint(title), nil
	}
}
```
then, do the changes as per the need. This is a very breaking change so this has to be some with cautious.

### Use switch case for checking the type of `Color`

<Chip level={'Medium'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/35"} />
**Description**

There are a lot of if conditions for checking the type of `Color` which makes it very hard to read and debug. A switch case will improve readability and help to debug much better.

For example box.go#L192 is long, and with a switch case, it can be done much more efficiently.

---
### Use termenv to detect color profile of terminals

<Chip level={'Medium'} url={"https://github.com/Delta456/box-cli-maker/issues/34"} />
**Description**

There is a lot of colour detection used in the library that can be removed, and [muesli/termenv](https://github.com/muesli/termenv) can be used to which will reduce the number of lines of code and boilerplate.

One will have to study all the `detect_platform` files to understand how colour profile checking by the module manually.
